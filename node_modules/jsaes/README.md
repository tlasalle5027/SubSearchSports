# jsaes: AES in JavaScript
> jsaes is a compact JavaScript implementation of the AES block cipher. Key lengths of 128, 192 and 256 bits are supported.

### Example
---
The following code example enciphers the plaintext block '00 11 22 .. EE FF' with the 256 bit key '00 01 02 .. 1E 1F'.
```javascript=
AES_Init();

var block = new Array(16);
for(var i = 0; i < 16; i++)
  block[i] = 0x11 * i;

var key = new Array(32);
for(var i = 0; i < 32; i++)
  key[i] = i;

AES_ExpandKey(key);
AES_Encrypt(block, key);

AES_Done();
```
### Usage
```javascript=
import * as AES from 'jsaes';
 <!-- OR -->
import {AES_init,AES_ExpandKey,AES_Encrypt,AES_Done } from 'jsaes';
// User in your projects file.
```
